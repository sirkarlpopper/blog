<p><strong>Not The Real Karl Popper</strong>

<p>One of the most striking images from the Capitol riot was someone holding a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/in-pictures-55577824">Confederate flag inside the Capitol</a>, like Appomattox never happened.  As far as I can tell, the rioters genuinely thought the election was stolen.  Their rage was, in that sense, righteous.  But the origin of their anger was a lie&mdash;and that is why I believe the same Republic that survived the Civil War is in grave danger.</p>
<p>The GOP leadership has promoted the conspiracy theory that hundreds of people secretly coordinated to make sure Biden won by tens of thousands of votes in multiple states. These GOP leaders could have presented evidence for this conspiracy in their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-election_lawsuits_related_to_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election">~50 lawsuits</a>, or during one of their many television appearances, but <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-lawsuits-elections-b5d3cd1700b0fe9282707e571ec7c076">none has been forthcoming</a>.  Republican-appointed judges, including the Supreme Court, have thrown out their complaints, often with <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057/gov.uscourts.pamd.127057.202.0_1.pdf">scathing rebukes</a>. But, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/tracking-voter-trust-in-elections/">as of December 22</a>, only 28% of Republican voters believed November's election was free and fair, and 56% of the same group said the GOP lost these legal challenges because the courts were politically biased.</p>
<p>The wide acceptance of this theory is due to the actions of the GOP leadership. Senators Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley&mdash;both Ivy League educated lawyers&mdash;continually promoted it.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell dissembled for weeks about the election.  Roughly 150 congress people&mdash;including more than half of the GOP House caucus&mdash;chose to contest the certification of the election results.  Given that lawmakers are intimately familiar with both the law and the mechanics of voting, it is unlikely they believe the allegations of this theory any more than the judges who slammed those lawsuits. <em>Put plainly: the leaders of the GOP have spread a lie they do not believe</em>.</p>
<p>But why?  The choice is rational and Machiavellian: they think espousing this theory will engage the base and increase their personal power.  But this choice has grave consequences.  To grow their power, the GOP leadership has decided to undermine the Republic itself.  Through their action they have normalized the idea that an election is only fair if the correct person wins. And this conviction, now absorbed by millions of citizens, is not going away: it will be with us for years&mdash;likely decades&mdash;to come.  The riot in the Capitol was just a small, local manifestation of this sea change in American democracy.</p>
<p>Many have studied the rise of illiberalism in places like Hungary. After the fall of the Soviet Union, Hungary spent 20 years as a representative democracy.  In 2010, the Fidesz party rose to power, ultimately <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/explaining-eastern-europe-orbans-laboratory-of-illiberalism/">creating a right-wing "illiberal democracy"</a>; Hungary still holds elections, but the outcomes are known in advance. A key strategy employed by Fidesz was to <a href="https://www.cidob.org/en/articulos/monografias/illiberals/illiberal_democracy_in_hungary_the_social_background_and_practical_steps_of_building_an_illiberal_state">undermine confidence in democratic institutions</a>.  If people don't think their vote counts, why should they care if someone takes the right to vote away?  The same process has been repeated recently in <a href="https://www.demdigest.org/turkeys-soft-dictatorship-how-to-combat-erdogans-illiberal-populism/">Turkey</a>, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/poland-could-lose-its-democracy/599590/">Poland</a>, <a href="https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2017/9/19/16333360/brazilians-losing-faith-democracy">Brazil</a>, and <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2018/11/02/460498/rise-far-right-populism-threatens-global-democracy-security/">other countries</a>.</p>
<p>I doubt that Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley envisions themselves as a dictator in the future, but their long-term intentions do not matter. Cruz and Hawley&mdash;and most of the leadership of the GOP&mdash;have chosen, for their own gain, to attack the Republic itself with baseless claims. One of the two major parties has chosen power over truth; we are on the <a href="https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/new-global-landscape-illiberal-regimes-and-movements">same path as Hungary</a>.</p>
<p>Now I can imagine two "what about" objections that might immediately come to mind.  The first is, "What about the Russia investigation?  Isn't that basically the same thing as what the GOP leadership is doing?"  The second is, "What about activists who argue that minorities are being discriminated against at polling places?  Aren't they sowing distrust in the political system?"  The key differentiation between the GOP conspiracy and these examples is their basis in fact.  For the Russian affair, there was an extensive investigation&mdash;following the rule of law&mdash;that led to a final report <a href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf">cataloging evidence of Russian interference</a>.  It is well documented that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/07/poll-prri-voter-suppression/565355/">Black and minority voters have more difficulty voting</a>, that <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/smartphone-data-show-voters-in-black-neighborhoods-wait-longer1/">it takes longer for them to vote</a>, and that they <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/17/924527679/why-do-nonwhite-georgia-voters-have-to-wait-in-line-for-hours-too-few-polling-pl">have systematically fewer polling places</a>.  The Democratic Party has many, many flaws, but lying to directly undermine the Republic is not yet their go-to strategy.</p>
<p>The philosopher John Rawls wrote in his <em>Theory of Justice</em> (p. 3) that</p>
<blockquote><p>Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust.... Being first virtues of human activities, truth and justice are uncompromising.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The quote brings together the threads of justice and truth. An idea must be rejected if it's not true; a system must be rejected if it's not just. But these ideas are also intertwined.  If we base our social institutions on lies, we lose justice. If a large fraction of the polity rejects an electoral outcome because their leaders insist they <em>actually</em> won, regardless of the facts, our Republic falls and injustice follows.</p>
<p>And these lies about the election are not some isolated feature of the GOP.  On any issue of social or political importance, one can find mainstream GOP leaders peddling conspiracy theories or outright lies. Aside from obvious untruths like <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/19/politics/giuliani-trump-legal-team-press-briefing-fact-check/index.html">"corrupted Dominion voting machines were built by Hugo Chavez"</a>,  a non-exhaustive list could include <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/spreading-covid-19-misinformation/story?id=70615995">"COVID-19 is just the flu"</a>, <a href="https://www.skepticalscience.com/skepticquotes.php">"climate change is a hoax"</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/politics/systemic-racism-trump-administration-officials-barr-carson-wolf/index.html">"systemic racism does not exist in the US"</a>, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/02/how-mike-pence-made-indianas-hiv-outbreak-worse-118648">"needle exchanges encourage drug abuse"</a>, and <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/apr/01/chris-sgro/equality-nc-director-no-public-safety-risks-cities/">"transgender people are dangerous"</a>. These lies touch on complex issues where there is room for disagreement&mdash;but controversy does not excuse intentional falsehood. And, while every political movement has cranks and fringe characters, the GOP has decided that misinformation is a <em>primary</em> strategy.  As GOP strategist Steve Bannon memorably put it, it's not accidental, it's a tactical decision: <a href="https://time.com/5860215/domestic-disinformation-growing-menace-america/">"Flood the zone with shit"</a>.</p>
<p>I am deeply pessimistic that we will escape this trajectory into illiberalism. There is no way to <em>make</em> the GOP leadership behave with integrity. When a group rejects democratic norms, they cannot be stopped by appeal to those norms. As he helped dismantle the Roman Republic, Pompey the Great declared to legal challengers: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2018/10/31/this-is-how-republics-end/">"Cease quoting laws to those of us with swords."</a></p>
<p>I suspect that the only people who can effect change are individual Republican citizens.  Unless a large number of them say "Enough!" and abandon the GOP, this will continue&mdash;and likely get worse.  Why would the GOP leadership behave with integrity if lying energizes the base, but does not drive away principled voters? I can be angry, journalists can write articles, and Democratic politicians can implore their colleagues to respect electoral outcomes.  But such gestures will have no effect.</p>
<p>It seems this puts individual Republicans into a difficult situation. People join the GOP because it represents their values, at least approximately.  As popular as it is in some circles, I reject the notion that Republican citizens are simply deluded, foolish, or evil.  If a Republican abandoned the GOP, with whom would they work to advance their personal priorities?  Where would an ex-Republican go, particularly if Democratic values are truly antithetical to their own?</p>
<p>Making it even harder, the tactics employed by the GOP leadership are powerful and will likely be effective.  Hardball politics are the reason the GOP now controls the Supreme Court, most State Houses, and that the Democrat congressional majority will likely be overwhelmed in two years.  I can even imagine that a future soft dictatorship might bring about a lot of changes desired by individual Republicans.  A strong leader could ban abortion outright, declare marriage as being between a man and woman, and promote the role of the church in society.  For a principled Republican, are those values more important than the Republic itself?</p>
<p>I do not know the answer to these questions. But I am convinced that the future of the Republic is in the hands of individual, principled Republicans.</p>
<p>I wish I could be hopeful.</p>
